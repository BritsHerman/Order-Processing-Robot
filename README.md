# Order-Processing-Robot
The order processing robot was a robot that I had to create for the robocorp level 2 course, where you had to dive into the 
documentation and learn everything you needed to complete the robot yourself. 

## Tasks that had to be completed
-    Order robots from the RobotSpareBin Industries inc website using the csv file. 
-    Save the order HTML receipt as a PDF.
-    Save the screenshot of the robot.
-    Embed the screenshot of the robot into the PDF file where the receipt is.
-    Create a ZIP archive of all the files generated from the process.
